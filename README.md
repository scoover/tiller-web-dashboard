# Tiller Web Dashboard
Spreadsheets are a great tool for personal finance, but they typically aren't very user friendly when you are on the go. 

The **tiller-web-dashboard** project leverages the ability to deploy Google-Apps-Script web apps to publish a real-time, responsive dashboard for your personal-finance spreadsheets.
